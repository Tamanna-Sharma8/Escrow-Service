Multi-signature Wallet
A secure and efficient multi-signature wallet smart contract built with Solidity and deployed using Hardhat on Core Testnet 2.

Project Description
This Multi-signature Wallet is a decentralized smart contract that requires multiple signatures from authorized owners to execute transactions. It provides enhanced security for managing digital assets by distributing control among multiple parties, making it ideal for organizations, DAOs, and shared fund management.

The wallet implements a robust confirmation system where transactions must be approved by a minimum number of owners before execution. This eliminates single points of failure and ensures that no individual can unilaterally control the funds.

Project Vision
Our vision is to create a trustless, secure, and user-friendly multi-signature wallet solution that empowers individuals and organizations to manage their digital assets with confidence. By leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts, we aim to provide:

Enhanced Security: Multi-party approval system that prevents unauthorized transactions
Transparency: All transactions and approvals are recorded on the blockchain
Decentralization: No single point of failure or control
Accessibility: Easy-to-use interface for managing shared funds
Scalability: Support for various numbers of owners and confirmation requirements
Key Features
Core Functionality
Multi-owner Support: Configure multiple wallet owners with customizable confirmation requirements
Transaction Submission: Owners can propose transactions for execution
Confirmation System: Secure approval process requiring minimum confirmations
Transaction Execution: Automatic execution once confirmation threshold is met
Revocation Mechanism: Owners can revoke their confirmations before execution
Security Features
Access Control: Only authorized owners can interact with wallet functions
Confirmation Validation: Prevents double-confirmation and unauthorized execution
Gas Optimization: Efficient code structure to minimize transaction costs
Event Logging: Comprehensive event system for transaction tracking
