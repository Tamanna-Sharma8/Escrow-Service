# Escrow Service

A decentralized escrow service built on blockchain technology that enables secure peer-to-peer transactions without the need for traditional intermediaries.

## Project Description

The Escrow Service is a smart contract-based solution that acts as a trusted third party for transactions between buyers and sellers. It holds funds in escrow until both parties fulfill their obligations, ensuring secure and trustless transactions on the blockchain. The service includes dispute resolution mechanisms and automated fund release capabilities.

## Project Vision

To create a trustless, transparent, and efficient escrow system that eliminates the need for traditional intermediaries while providing security and dispute resolution for peer-to-peer transactions. Our vision is to democratize access to secure transaction services and reduce costs associated with traditional escrow services.
